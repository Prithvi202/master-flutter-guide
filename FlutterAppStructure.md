# Flutter App Structure Overview

## Introduction to Flutter
Flutter is a UI toolkit developed by Google for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

## Basic Flutter App Structure Diagram
A typical Flutter app has a hierarchical structure, with the main components being `main.dart`, `MaterialApp`, and `Scaffold`. Understanding this structure is crucial for effective Flutter development.

## Explanation of the Main Components
- **main.dart:** Entry point of the Flutter app.
- **MaterialApp:** Wraps the entire app and provides material design specific functionality.
- **Scaffold:** Represents the basic structure of the visual interface, including the app bar, body, and bottom navigation.

## Explanation of Main Components

### main.dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

### MaterialApp
MaterialApp(
  title: 'My Flutter App',
  theme: ThemeData(
    primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
  ),
  home: MyHomePage(),
);

### Scaffold
Scaffold(
  appBar: AppBar(
    title: Text('My App'),
  ),
  body: Center(
    child: Text('Hello, Flutter!'),
  ),
);
