# Flutter Best Practices

Welcome to the Flutter Best Practices guide! In this section, we'll cover coding conventions, folder structure recommendations, and performance optimization tips.

## Coding Conventions

Adhering to coding conventions ensures consistency across your codebase. Follow the [Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style) for Dart-specific conventions.

## Folder Structure Recommendations

A well-organized folder structure makes your project more maintainable. Consider the following structure:

```plaintext
lib/
|-- screens/
|-- widgets/
|-- models/
|-- services/
|-- utils/
|-- main.dart
```
screens: UI screens or pages.
widgets: Reusable UI components.
models: Data models.
services: Business logic and data fetching services.
utils: Utility functions.

### Performance Optimization Tips
Optimizing performance is crucial for a smooth user experience. Some tips include:

Use const constructors: For widgets and objects that won't change.
Minimize widget rebuilds: Use const widgets and memoization techniques.
Lazy loading: Load data and resources only when needed.
