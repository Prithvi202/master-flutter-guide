# Layouts in Flutter

Welcome to the Layouts in Flutter guide! In this section, we'll explore the layout concepts and common layouts in Flutter.

## Overview of Layout Concepts

In Flutter, layouts are used to arrange and organize widgets on the screen. Understanding different layout concepts is crucial for building responsive and visually appealing user interfaces.

## Examples of Common Layouts

### SingleChildScrollView

The SingleChildScrollView widget allows its child to be scrolled vertically.

```dart
SingleChildScrollView(
  child: Column(
    children: <Widget>[
      // Your widgets here
    ],
  ),
)
```
### ListView
ListView is a scrollable list of widgets.

```dart
ListView(
  children: <Widget>[
    ListTile(
      title: Text('Item 1'),
    ),
    ListTile(
      title: Text('Item 2'),
    ),
    // More list items
  ],
)

```
### Stack
The Stack widget allows widgets to be overlaid.

```dart
Stack(
  children: <Widget>[
    Positioned(
      top: 10,
      left: 10,
      child: Text('Top Left'),
    ),
    Positioned(
      bottom: 10,
      right: 10,
      child: Text('Bottom Right'),
    ),
  ],
)
```
### Handling Responsive Layouts
Creating responsive layouts ensures that your app looks good on various devices and screen sizes.

```dart
LayoutBuilder(
  builder: (context, constraints) {
    if (constraints.maxWidth > 600) {
      // Use a wide layout
      return WideLayout();
    } else {
      // Use a narrow layout
      return NarrowLayout();
    }
  },
)
```
